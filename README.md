# React + Express No-Fluff Boilerplate

A boilerplate project for anyone interested in making a project that uses React and Express.

This repository is a bootleg of @NimaBoscarino's [React Rails Boilerplate](https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/react-rails-boilerplate). It uses the same React app, but replaces the Rails server with an Express server.

Note! This boilerplate has _no fluff_! That means that there's nothing set up for you to do authentication stuff, there's no Redux stuff, and there's no React Router stuff. On the Express end, there is no session storage or database connection.

The main important bit is that the React project has `proxy` set to `localhost:8080` in the `package.json` file, and that the Express app listens to port 8080 in `server.js`. Take a look!

You can (and perhaps should) rename the directories `express-back-end` and `react-front-end` if you want-- The name doesn't matter.

## Running the projects

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.

If this doesn't work, please message me!
